# Introduction
AI strives to understand and study intelligence as whole, including the human brain. But unlike philosophy and psychology, which are mostly concerned only with human intelligence, AI studies the very nature of intelligence and strives to build intelligent entities in order to understand them.

AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subfields, from general-purpose areas such as perception and logical reasoning, to specific tasks such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, and diagnosing diseases.

## What is AI?
There are two major ways in which AI can be thought of.
> The study of mental faculties through the
use of computational models

> The study of the computations that make
it possible to perceive, reason, and act

One is concerned with rashnality, and the other with human intelligence. It all depends on the use and why we are using it.

We can quanitfy both these behaviours (human-cognition and rationality) in certain ways.

- Thinking humanly:
  
  This involves cognitive modelling, i.e. studying how our human brain thinks. This can be done by introspection (catching our own thoughts) and through psychological experiments. We have to create a **model of the mind.** Once we have sufficient model of the way the brain works, we have to express this theory as a computer program. If the program's input/output and timing behavior matches human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program's mechanisms may also be operating in humans.
- Acting humanly:
  
  This introduces something called the **Turing Test**, which was proposed by Alan Turing. Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator. Roughly speaking, the test he proposed is that the computer should be interrogated by a human via a teletype, and passes the test if the interrogator cannot tell if there is a computer or a human at the other end.
- Thinking rationally:
  
  This makes use of the mathematical field of **logic** and uses formal proofs etc. There are two main obstacles to this approach. First, it is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation, particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain. Second, there is a big difference between being able to solve a problem "in principle" and doing so in practice.
- Acting rationally:
  
  In this approach, AI is viewed as the study and construction of rational agents. In the **thinking rationally** approach we rely on the AI making correct inferences based on the data/knowledge provided. However, sometimes making correct inferences is only part of being a rational agent. Correct inference is not all of rationality, because there are often situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet something must still be done.

  The study of AI as rational agent design therefore has two advantages. First, it is more general than the "laws of thought" approach, because correct inference is only a useful mechanism for achieving rationality, and not a necessary one. Second, it is more amenable to scientific development than approaches based on human behavior or human thought, because the standard of rationality is clearly defined and completely general. Human behavior, on the other hand, is well-adapted for one specific environment and is the product, in part, of a complicated and largely unknown evolutionary process that still may be far from achieving perfection.


### So why did we study all these things so far?
We understood the various approaches that we can use to define, study and work on developing intelligent machines.We can not trust human behaviour as a guide to intelligence as it is adapted to a very specific environment and may still be very far from perfection. This
book will therefore concentrate on general principles of rational agents, and on components for constructing them.

One important point to keep in mind: we will see before too long that achieving perfect
rationality—always doing the right thing—is not possible in complicated environments. The
computational demands are just too high.
